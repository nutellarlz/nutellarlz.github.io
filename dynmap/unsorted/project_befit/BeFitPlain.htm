		<ol>
		<p>Linear Fit Machines are the best in weight machines and the LFM600
		leads the field. Designed for both <b><i>serious</i></b> fitness users and <b><i>beginners</i></b>, the
		LFM600's vertical model provides all of the <i>safety</i> and <i>control</i> associated
		with BeFit Machines, while still allowing for the effective use of gravity
		for effective resistance. You don't even need a workout partner. You can set lock points
		to prevent the bar from moving outside of your body's natural
		ange of motion.</p>
		<!--<br>-->
		<p>You can modify the LFM600 to meet you specific workout needs. Start with the
		basic package of the BeFit Machine rack and, as your needs grow, add a 
		lat/row, pec dec, plate tree, dip, and accessory organizer. Accessories are easy
		to insert and remove, allowing you to continue your workout without delay.   
		The LFM600 works with all standard Olympic weight plates</p>
		<!--<br>-->
		<p>The LFM600 is compact with all components place one side of the unit for easy
		ccess. This makes the LFM600 perfect for people who want a quality home gym, but
		don't have a lot of space. Place the LFM600 against a wall and you're ready
		to go.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Smooth BeFit Action:</li>
					<ol>
						<p>The bar (rated at 700 lb. capacity) slides on Teflon bushings
						alongside solid steel guide rods. Smooth motion is key to successful workouts,
						as the target muscles are utilized to their full potential with each repetition.</p>
					</ol>
					
					<li>Proper Angle:</li>
					<ol>
						<p>The bar travels along an 8 degree path from vertical. Studies have
						shown that this is the proper lifting angle to increase your comfort and
						prevent injury.</p>
					</ol>
					
					<li>Safety:</li>
					<ol>
						<p>The LFM600 has 20 lock-out points for a safe, solid stop at 
						any point in your workout routine.</p>
					</ol>
					
					<li>Rugged:</li>
					<ol>
						<p>Constructed with heavy 12 gauge steel and 7 gauge reinforcing plate. This is
						a unit built to last.</p>
