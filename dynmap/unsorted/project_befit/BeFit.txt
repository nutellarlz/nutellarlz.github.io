BeFit LFM600 Linear Fit Machine

Overview
Linear Fit Machines are the best in weight machines and the LFM600
leads the field. Designed for both serious fitness users and beginners, the
LFM600's vertical model provides all of the safety and control associated
with BeFit Machines, while still allowing for the effective use of gravity
for effective resistance. You don't even need a workout partner. You can set lock points
to prevent the bar from moving outside of your body's natural
range of motion.

You can modify the LFM600 to meet you specific workout needs. Start with the
basic package of the BeFit Machine rack and, as your needs grow, add a 
lat/row, pec dec, plate tree, dip, and accessory organizer. Accessories are easy
to insert and remove, allowing you to continue your workout without delay.   
The LFM600 works with all standard Olympic weight plates

The LFM600 is compact with all components place one side of the unit for easy
access. This makes the LFM600 perfect for people who want a quality home gym, but
don't have a lot of space. Place the LFM600 against a wall and you're ready
to go.

prevent injury.

any point in your workout routine.
